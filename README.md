### Hi there! I'm kale <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/z1AumTBpH3RoeKsaG6/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47oujyn5vkjx1i6er8yiadezrn813ibi7w90dzb0pp&ep=v1_stickers_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=s" width="35" height="35" />

I'm [**Kaleigh**]([https://gazijarin.com](https://kaleighfeder.vercel.app/)), a Junior Software Developer at Jumping Elephants currently located in Kitchener with a Computing degree (AI major) from Queen's University. I've previously interned at Statistics Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency.

What excites me about Full Stack development is bridging the gap between my creative and technical sides with work that makes a big impact.
