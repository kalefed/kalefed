I am currently a Computer Science Student, with a focus in Artificial Intelligence at Queen's University. I've taken a variety of courses such as relativity, video game design and data structures. I am an aspiring full stack developer who loves combining my passion for art and design with programming! I spend my free time reading books, creating art and watching anything to do with Star Wars.
