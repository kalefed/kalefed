I spend my free time reading books, creating art and watching anything to do with Star Wars.

ðŸš€ **Current Projects**: I'm currently working on my portfolio website, striving to make it a reflection of my skills and passions.

ðŸ§  **Learning Journey**: I'm constantly expanding my knowledge, currently delving into the world of Next.js and Tailwind to continue developing my front-end development skills.
